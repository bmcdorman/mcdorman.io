Working with Dr. Dean Hougen on alternative methods of evolutionary computation that combine the benefits of objective-based and novelty-based heuristics. Our methodology is heavily biologically inspired, including concepts such as speciation and resource competition, which leads to a distribution of solutions in the problem space (as observed in biological evolution) rather than a single convergent solution. This approach yielded significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art in learning of "genetic programs" for tasks such as maze solving.
