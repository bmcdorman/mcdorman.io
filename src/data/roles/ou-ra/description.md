Worked with Dr. Dean Hougen on alternative methods of evolutionary computation that combine the benefits of objective-based and novelty-based heuristics. Our methodology was biologically inspired, including concepts such as speciation and resource competition, which lead to a distribution of solutions in the problem space (i.e., speciation, as observed in biological evolution) rather than a single convergent solution. This approach yielded significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art solutions in learning of "genetic programs" for tasks such as maze solving.

Implemented a high-performance GPGPU-based simulation environment for conducting experiments.
