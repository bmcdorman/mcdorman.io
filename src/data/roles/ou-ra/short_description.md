Worked with Dr. Dean Hougen on novel evolutionary computation methods. Our methodology led to a distribution of solutions in the problem space rather than a single convergent solution, which yielded significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art solutions. Implemented a high-performance CUDA-based simulation environment for conducting massively parallel experiments.
