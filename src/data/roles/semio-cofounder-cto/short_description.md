Co-founded Semio, a social robotics software startup, to create the operating system, app ecosystem, and developer tools for social robots. Grew the company to $1M annual revenue with no venture capital investment (i.e., bootstrapped).

Architected all aspects of Semio's products (including web front-end, back-end, cloud infrastructure, 3D simulation environment, social behavior models, and on-robot software, including high-level and firmware/kernel-level components). Managed contractors and interns. Aligned and iterated with Fortune 100 customer teams to address their needs.

Learned how to (and frequently how not to) build a company and product from scratch, including how to manage finances, customer relationships, and product development.
