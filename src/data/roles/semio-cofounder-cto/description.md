Co-founded Semio, a social robotics software startup, to create the operating system, app ecosystem, and developer tools for social robots. Grew the company to $1M annual revenue with no venture capital investment (i.e., bootstrapped).

Architected and partially or fully implemented all aspects of Semio's products (including web front-end, back-end, cloud infrastructure, 3D simulation environment, social behavior models, and on-robot software, including high-level and firmware/kernel-level components). Managed contractors, interns, and other technical team members. Communicated and iterated with large customer teams with many stakeholders to address their needs. Deployed large, complex, and highly specialized software to enterprise customers with rigorous quality, documentation, and support requirements.

Learned how to (and frequently how not to) build a company and product from scratch, including how to manage finances, manage customer relationships, manage product development, protect intellectual property, and manage a company's overall direction.

Products purchased by numerous Fortune 100 companies and universities.
