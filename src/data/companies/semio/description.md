Semio is a Los Angeles-based software startup defining the way in which people will live, work, and play with robots in their everyday lives. Semio is developing an operating system, app ecosystem, and developer tools for personal robots. Semio software allows robot developers to rapidly create and deploy robot apps, and allows robot end-users to transparently access and use those robot apps via natural communication, including both speech and body language. What Microsoft Windows did for personal computing—what Android did for smartphones—Semio is doing for personal robots.
