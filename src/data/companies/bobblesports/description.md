Bobble Sports is a fan-driven technology company that enables sports leagues and
broadcasters to elicit, capture, and analyze authentic fan reactions in real-time from
anywhere in the world.

The value to the fan is their ability to remotely participate in the game and have their
reactions be an actual part of the game, providing a fun and shared experience with their
friends, family, and fellow fans.

The value to teams, leagues, and broadcasters is increased fan engagement, renewed
traffic to their apps, and incentives to re-engage and maintain subscribers and season
ticket holders.


Our proprietary technology enables us to learn and predict how fans react to their
favorite teams and events, so we can ensure that their reactions are synced up with a
live broadcast even if there is significant broadcast latency.

We use artificial intelligence (AI) to convert physical and emotional fan
reactions into high-quality, clean, and customizable audio streams, which
can be mixed into venues and live broadcast streams.
