KISS Institute for Practical Robotics (KIPR) was incorporated as a 501(c) 3 organization in 1994 to make the long-term educational benefits of robotics accessible to students. Our name is the well-known acronym (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and students tell us that this motto has been quite useful in designing their robots. KIPR’s Mission is to:

 - Improve the public’s understanding of science, technology, engineering, and math;
 - Develop the skills, character, and aspirations of students; and
 - Contribute to the enrichment of our school systems, communities, and the nation.
