Quori is a NSF-funded platform for researchers in higher education institutions to perform novel research in human-robot interaction.

I developed the embedded microcontroller code, high-level Robot Operating System control code, perception libraries, and high-performance face visualization (via OpenGL and shaders).

I also integrated Semio's products with the platform to allow animation, dialog, and other behaviors to be easily created, tested, and deployed.
