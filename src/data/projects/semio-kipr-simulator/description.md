The KIPR Simulator is a web-based 3D simulation environment for K-12 students and educators to learn how to program a robot in C, C++, and Python. Students can actuate motors and servos and read simulated sensor values (e.g., light sensors, reflectance sensors, touch sensors, and more).

Semio provided substantial contributions to the KIPR simulator, including UI components, simulation environment, "world" system, database system, and more. I also worked on this project as a volunteer.
